How to Organize Pages and API Routes

Login Page (login.astro):
- Create a login form.
- On form submission, make a POST request to /api/login.

Registration Page (register.astro):
- Similar to the login page but with additional fields (username, email, password).
- POST the form data to /api/register.

Product Catalog (index.astro):
- Fetch product data from the API (/api/products) and display each product using the ProductCard component.

Shopping Cart (cart.astro):
- Fetch the current user's cart from /api/cart and display the cart items using the CartItem component.
- Allow users to add or remove items using API routes like /api/cart/add and /api/cart/remove.

Product Detail Page (product/[id].astro):
- Use a dynamic route to fetch a single product by its ID from Strapi (/api/products/:id) and display the full product information.

// Checkout Page (checkout.astro):
// - Fetch the current user's cart from /api/cart.
// - Calculate the total price and display it.
// - Allow users to complete the purchase using the API route /api/checkout.

// Order Confirmation (order-confirmation.astro):
// - Display the order details and confirmation number.
